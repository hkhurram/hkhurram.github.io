			<h2>MAZE-SOLVING ROBOT</h2>
			<img src="maze.png">
			<p>As a part of the Princeton Brown Robotics Team, I am working alongside peers to design, build, and program a robot that can solve a maze. The robot will be entered into the Brown IEEE Robotics Competition.</p>
		</div>

			<h2>AUTOCOMPLETE</h2>
			<img src="autocomplete.png">
			<p>I implemented a version of autocomplete that takes in a term, which consists of a query string an integer weight. Using the query and integer weight, the programs finds all queries that start with the given string and ranks them by weight.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entry">
			<h2>8 PUZZLE</h2>
			<img src="8puzzle.png">
			<p>I implemented a method to solve a slider puzzle using the A* algorithm. The puzzle is a n-by-n board that must have its elements put in row-major order in as few moves as possible.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entry">
			<h2>DEQUES & RANDOMIZED QUEUES</h2>
			<img src="queues.png">
			<p>In this program, I implemented the elementary data types of deques and randomized queues using arrays and linked lists. The data types support a variety of operations, such as running an iterator over the items from the front of the structure to the end, removing and returning items, adding items to the front and back, etc.</p>
		</div>

		<div id="entry">
			<h2>PERCOLATION</h2>
			<img src="percolation.png">
			<p>This program models a percolation system with n-by-n sites. The program estimates the percolation threshold, which is the threshold below which a random n-by-n grid almost never percolates and above which a grid almost always percolates. Using this threshold, the program visually models the percolation of a system.</p>
