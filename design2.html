		<h2>ENGINEERS WITHOUT BORDERS - PERU</h2>
		<p>I designed a logo for the Engineers Without Borders - Peru chapter at Princeton. I focused on creating a design that was minimalistic, 
		but still represented the mission and identity of the team. I chose to use an outline of the Huayna Picchu Mountain as the basis of my 
	    design. </p>
